      "synthesis\n",
      "means composition, or making a whole out of its parts. In Geometry however these words are used in a more special sense. In synthesis we begin with results already established, and end with some new result; thus, by the aid of theorems already demonstrated, and problems already solved, we demonstrate some new theorem, or solve some new problem. In analysis we begin with assuming the truth of some theorem or the solution of some problem, and we deduce from the assumption consequences which we can compare with results already established, and thus test the validity of our assumption.\n",
      "36. The propositions in Euclid's Elements are all exhibited synthetically; the student is only employed in examining the soundness of the reasoning by which each successive addition is made to the collection of geometrical truths already obtained; and there is no hint given as to the manner in which the propositions were originally discovered. Some of the constructions and demonstrations appear rather artificial, and we are thus naturally induced to enquire whether any 'rules can be discovered by which we may be guided easily and naturally to the investigation of new propositions.\n",
      "​\n",
      "37. Geometrical analysis has sometimes been described in language which might lead to the expectation that directions could be given which would, enable a student to proceed to the demonstration of any proposed theorem, or the solution of any proposed problem, with confidence of success; but no such directions can be given. We will state the exact extent of these directions. Suppose that a new theorem is proposed for investigation, or a new problem for trial. Assume the truth of the theorem or the solution of the problem, and deduce consequences from this assumption combined with results which have been already established. If a consequence can be deduced which contradicts some result already established, this amounts to a demonstration that our assumption is inadmissible; that is, the theorem is not true, or the problem cannot be solved. If a consequence can be deduced which coincides with some result already established, we cannot say that the assumption is inadmissible; and it\n",
      "may happen\n",
      "that by starting from the consequence which we deduced, and retracing our steps, we can succeed in giving a synthetical demonstration of the theorem, or solution of the problem. These directions however are very vague, because no certain rule can be prescribed by which we are to combine our assumption with results already established; and moreover no test exists by which we can ascertain whether a valid consequence which we have drawn from an assumption will enable us to establish the assumption itself. That a proposition may be false and yet furnish consequences which are true, can be seen from a simple example. Suppose a theorem were proposed for investigation in the following words;\n",
      "one angle of a triangle is to another as the side opposite to the first angle is to the side opposite to the other.\n",
      "If this be assumed to be true we can immediately deduce Euclid's result in I. 19; but from Euclid's result in I. 19 we cannot retrace our steps and establish the proposed theorem, and in fact the proposed theorem is false.\n",
      "Thus the only definite statement in the directions respecting Geometrical analysis is, that if a consequence can be deduced from an assumed proposition which contradicts a result already established, that assumed proposition must be false.\n",
      "​\n",
      "38. We may mention, in particular, that a consequence would contradict results already established, if we could shew that it would lead to the solution of a problem already given up as impossible. There are three famous problems which are now admitted to be beyond the power of Geometry; namely, to find a straight line equal in length to the circumference of a given circle, to trisect any given angle, and to find two mean proportionals between two given straight lines. The grounds on which the geometrical solution of these problems is admitted to be impossible cannot be explained without a knowledge of the higher parts of mathematics; the student of the Elements may however be content with the fact that innumerable attempts have been made to obtain solutions, and that these attempts have been made in vain.\n",
